Hello, we start this tutorial, with the root window of "The Wheat Snooper".
you can see several textlines, groupboxes and comboboxes, 
the editor groupbox is for advanced usage and you must not worrie about it.

the nickname groupbox displays your nickname in wormnet, change this name to everything you want.
it has a regular expression installed, so you cannot pick unsupported letters.

the password groupbox, can be used for secure registration (if that will be implemented to wormnet one day). 
to enable secure login you must go into the editor and clean the ip from [irc ip] section.
if you do that nicknames cannot include ` signs anymore. but until wormnet secure login is not implemented we dont need it.

the next are flags and ranks, the clan tag and the client from yourself, that others will see in wormnet. let me say some words to this.
wormnet mods may argue about this propertys in future: that you must mark yourself as a snooper.
in that case, to avoid trouble with this guys, you should change the rank to 12 and name the client with "snooper".
these settings let you also hide your client to others, so you can appear exactly as a prosnooper2 client or the game itself.
people are then only able to debunk your secret, if they send a versioning to you, because versioning is just not implemented.

after setting all up, you click choose and the snooper will then connect to wormnet, if you ever come back to this settings tab,
the snooper will automaticly disconnect you from wormnet.
