This picture shows the menu which opens when you rightclick the trayicon on your controlpanel.
under stuff you can open an about windows and the settingswindow. 
the skins can be choosen on runtime. you can choose several layouts which affect the channelwindows.
a leftclick to the trayicon will hide the root window.

If you dont join a channel, you can still receive private messages, when the snooper is connected to wormnet. 
so if you havent joint a channel and you only see the tray icon, the snooper will open a chatwindow,
for every private messages attempt from all users except users in the ignorelist.
