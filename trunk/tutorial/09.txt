ok, now i come to a more complicated part of my snooper,
you see there are some channels listed in the userview. we would of course expect now that the users inside the channels are are all the 
users in this channel.
but this is not the case. the snooper can see everyone in wormnet. 
but if you watch in a channel that you havent joined, the display might not be correct.

for example you join anythinggoes the display for anythinggoes will be correct, you see all connected users, but if you look in ropersheaven 
you will not see a correct list. to get a correct list of ropersheaven you must just join ropersheaven too.

the trick here is that the snooper can see everyone in wormnet, but if a user has joined 2 channels and you havent joined this both channels,
it may happen to you that he will only be displayed once.

let me give you a more compressed explaination:

the snooper shows every user in wormnet, but it cannot show correct userlists from channels that you havent joined.

that appears to be a bug, but on the other side it makes it possible to allways see your buddys, independent to the channel he has joined.
and you can also chat with this user when he is anythinggoes and you are not.

you wont find this functionality in another snooper program.



ok this is now the end of my tutorial, i hope you will become happy with my work.
if you find bugs or you have comments or wishes or just want to talk about it, you can register in my forum and post them.
