WINDOWS:

Download the Qt SDK from 

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

install it and open the Qt Command Prompt (can be found in the windows start menu under Qt SDK by nokia...)

browse to this directory ( cd path\to\wheat\sources ) and write release_script_windows.bat

Now wait some minutes , maybe 10min, until the script finished executing.

now go in the subfolder "The Wheat Snooper" and execute the program.

hf :)

If you want to work with the source, just use the QtCreator. Open the netcoupler.pro file with 
it, but first execute the script.
