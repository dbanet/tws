every folder here, represents a smileytheme, 
the snooper will produce a *.smileytheme file for every folder. 
this file ships the smiley theme you have settet. 

your smileys (pictures in png format!) must be in the right folder.


to make a new theme, 
just make a folder here copy all smiley pictures in this folder and restart the snooper. 


to share a smileytheme with another, 
you can simply send him the folder with the smiley pictures and the smileyscheme file. 
a snooper restart will then apply the new smiley theme.


the smileytheme file and the folder must have the same name. 
for example:

folder: mysmileytheme
theme file: mysmileytheme.smileytheme

.
