ok, this text is about sending special messages
if a message starts with:

> it will be an action
>> it will be a notice
>>> will be an action sended as a notice
>! it will be a raw action (for example >!VERSION)
/ sends a raw server command, for example:

/privmsg nick hello
/notice nick hello
/whowas nick
/notice #anythinggoes hello

pressing up and down when the chatline is in focus will work as expected.
