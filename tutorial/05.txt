here, you can see the chat view, this view is awesome in its functionality. as you can see i right clicked a texttype.
the texttype was a nickname, i can now choose a font, a color and open a chatwindow with this user.
if i choose another font, the next nicknames will appear in the new color. the same with fonts.
i could also richtclick the time and change the font and color of the next timestamps.
you see there are different texttypes let me list them:
nicknames, timestamps, servermessages, chattext from normal users, chattext from a buddy, internet links which start with http://, 
game links which start with wa://, notices, actions, private messages from normal users.

all this texttypes can be settet with a rightclick to them.
a gamelink will appear as GAMELINK, with a rightclick you can open a game information window, it shows you the whole gamelink.
also a rightclick to a gamelink lets you join this game directly. if you host a game the snooper will write this gamelink to the channelwindow,
so people can then join your game over this link and they must not wait until the game appears in the hostscreen.

a internet link can be leftclicked and the snooper will then open your browser and show the website, note that website links
must start with http:// and they cannot include whitespaces. a whitespace should appear as %20. for example:
http://www.The Wheat Snooper.com is invalid, you must write http://www.The%20Wheat%20Snooper.com then the snooper will parse it right.

you may wonder why the texttypes are already settet to different colors and fonts, this was done by me and the program safes this to the
/snpini/snpini file. you allready have a default snpini file in your snooper, this file is responsible for almost all settings. 
you can also delete this file, the snooper will generate a new one on next start.
